# TODO-APP

A Todo app that I built using the Flutter framework. 
This was a challenge project I gave myself to learn Dart as well as the Flutter framework.
Some challenges while building this app was understanding that widgets are the main way to build Flutter components.
This was also the first mobile app that I have built using Flutter but I am impressed by the simplicity and performance.
